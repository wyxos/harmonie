# Wyxos Harmonie

Wyxos Harmonie is a PHP library designed to streamline backend development for Laravel applications. This library can function alongside the Node.js plugin @wyxos/vision to deliver an enhanced development experience, but it is also fully capable of operating independently.

## Installation

To add Wyxos Harmonie to your project, simply run:

```shell
composer require wyxos/harmonie
```

## Usage

Wyxos Harmonie is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Detailed usage instructions and examples will be provided in the documentation (coming soon).

While this library is designed to work in conjunction with the @wyxos/vision Node.js plugin, they can also be used independently depending on the requirements of your project.
